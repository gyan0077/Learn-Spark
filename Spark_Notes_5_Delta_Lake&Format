========================= Delta Lake & Delta Format — Concepts  =========================
Delta Lake is an open storage layer that brings reliability and performance to data lakes by adding a transaction log on top of Parquet files.

🔹 What is Delta Lake?
Delta Lake = Parquet files + transaction log + smart metadata

🔹 What is Delta Format?
Delta format is how data is stored:
->  Actual data → Parquet files
->  Metadata & history → _delta_log/ directory

Delta Table
 ├── part-0000.parquet
 ├── part-0001.parquet
 └── _delta_log/
      ├── 000000.json
      ├── 000001.json
      └── ...

🔹 Core Concepts of Delta Lake
1️⃣ Transaction Log (_delta_log) ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT
-> Records every change to the table
-> Each commit creates a new version

Version 0 → initial load
Version 1 → append
Version 2 → update

2️⃣ ACID Transactions
Delta Lake guarantees:
Atomicity   – either all or nothing
Consistency – before & after change should remain unchanged
Isolation   – Transaction do not affect each other. (Multiple trx occur independently without interference)
Durability –  Commit data will save permanently.

3️⃣ Time Travel ⏳
Query older versions of data.
SELECT * FROM sales VERSION AS OF 5;

or --> Python
spark.read.format("delta") \
  .option("versionAsOf", 5) \
  .table("sales")
--> Perfect for rollback & auditing.

Delta Lake: “An open storage layer that adds ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel to data lakes.”
Delta Format: “Parquet files plus a transaction log that tracks all changes to a table.”
