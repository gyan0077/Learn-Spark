============= 1️⃣ Transformations - (They build the plan)
Transformations define what you want to do to the data.
They do not execute immediately.

============= 2️⃣ Actions - (They trigger execution)
Actions ask Spark for a result.
When an action is called, Spark executes the whole DAG.

============= 3️⃣ Lazy Evaluation (Why Spark waits)
Lazy evaluation means Spark waits until an action before doing any work.
Note: Spark first records transformations, then optimizes, then executes once.

============= Real-life analogy 🍳 =============
Transformations = writing a recipe.
Action = turning on the stove.
Lazy evaluation = not cooking until someone orders food.

=============================== Spark Transformations (Lazy – build the plan) =======================================
Transformations define what to do. They don’t execute immediately.

🔸 Narrow Transformations (NO shuffle)
Data from one partition stays in the same partition.
| -----------------------|-------------------------------------------- |
| Transformation         | What it does                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `select()`             | Choose columns                              |
| `filter()` / `where()` | Filter rows                                 |
| `withColumn()`         | Add/modify column                           |
| `drop()`               | Remove column                               |
| `map()`                | Row-wise transform                          |
| `flatMap()`            | Map + flatten                               |
| `sample()`             | Sample rows                                 |
| `limit()`              | Limit rows                                  |
| `distinct()`           | Remove duplicates (can cause shuffle later) |



🔸 Wide Transformations (Shuffle happens)
Data must move across partitions.
| Transformation         | What it does                        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `groupBy()`            | Group rows                          |
| `agg()`                | Aggregations                        |
| `join()`               | Combine DataFrames                  |
| `repartition()`        | Change partitions                   |
| `orderBy()` / `sort()` | Sort data                           |
| `cube()` / `rollup()`  | Multi-dim aggregations              |
| `coalesce()`           | Reduce partitions (no full shuffle) |


🔹 Spark Actions (Eager – trigger execution)
Actions trigger the execution of the entire DAG.
| Action          | Result               |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| `show()`        | Display rows         |
| `count()`       | Row count            |
| `collect()`     | Bring data to driver |
| `take(n)`       | First `n` rows       |
| `first()`       | First row            |
| `foreach()`     | Apply function       |
| `write()`       | Save to storage      |
| `saveAsTable()` | Save as table        |
| `reduce()`      | Aggregate values     |


🔹 Transformations vs Actions (Quick Recall)
| Aspect       | Transformation | Action          |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| Execution    | Lazy           | Immediate       |
| Builds DAG   | ✅              | ❌            |
| Triggers job | ❌              | ✅            |
| Output       | DataFrame      | Result / Output |


======================== Eager transaformation ==========================
Spark has NO eager transformations.
All Spark transformations are lazy.
Only actions are eager.

========================= What is Fault Tolerance in Spark? =========================
Fault tolerance means Spark can recover from failures (node, executor, task) without restarting the entire job or losing data.

🔹 Types of Failures Spark Handles
1️⃣ Executor failure (most common)
2️⃣ Task failure
3️⃣ Node failure
4️⃣ Data loss in memory
Spark handles all of these automatically.
