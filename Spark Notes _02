# ======================== What is a View in Databricks?
A view is a saved query:
❌ Does not store data
✅ Always reflects latest data


# ======================== Databricks 3 main types of views
🔹 1️⃣ Temporary View (Session Scope)
It Exists only in the current Spark session and It automatically deleted when notebook / session ends.

-- When to use
i)   Intermediate transformations
ii)  ETL pipelines
iii) Debugging

-- How to create (PySpark)
df.createOrReplaceTempView("temp_movies")

-- How to query
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM temp_movies").show()

-- Key points
i)  Not visible in Catalog
ii) Not shared across notebooks
iii) Very fast


🔹 2️⃣ Global Temporary View (Cluster Scope)
Shared across all notebooks, Exists as long as cluster is running.

-- When to use
i)  Share intermediate results across notebooks
ii) Team experiments

-- How to create (PySpark)
df.createOrReplaceGlobalTempView("global_movies")

-- How to query
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM global_temp.global_movies").show()

-- Key points
i)   Schema is always global_temp
ii)  Deleted when cluster stops
iii) Not stored permanently

🔹 3️⃣ Permanent View (Catalog View) ✅ (MOST IMPORTANT)
Stored in Unity Catalog
Persistent
Shared across users & notebooks

-- When to use
i)   Analytics
ii)  Reporting
iii) Production queries

-- How to create (SQL)
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW workspace.default.marvel_movies_view AS
SELECT *
FROM workspace.default.movies
WHERE studio = 'Marvel Studios';

-- How to query
SELECT title, release_year
FROM workspace.default.marvel_movies_view;

-- Key points
i)   Appears in Catalog
ii)  Survives restarts
iii) Slightly slower than temp views

# =============================== View vs Table
| View             | Table                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Stores query     | Stores data           |
| Lightweight      | Heavy                 |
| Auto-updates     | Static unless updated |
| Faster to create | Slower to create      |
